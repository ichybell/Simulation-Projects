# Die Roll
This is a Python program to introduce the concept of simulating random numbers. 

It involved the following
1. Generate a random number between 0 and 1 i.e. u(0,1) for 1000 iterations. Divide the 1000 random numbers into 6 equal parts i.e. a dice.
2. Using the form of a table, output your results whereby:
      1. 1st column represents the side of the dice i.e., 1,2,3...
      2. 2nd column represents the number of times the side occurred
      3. 3rd is the overall percentage the side occured relative to the total.
