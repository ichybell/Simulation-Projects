It is a car inventory system.

Cars 	SUV's 	Trucks

There is code available. Run code 
Code asks about the details about the car: Year of manufcuture, number of doors

The code is in Python. It is in book written by Tony Gaddis named Introduction to Python

There is also design of a class diagram from the book. It uses inheritance.
There is a general Class of Vechicle with the three types of vehciles inheriting e.g. Cars, SUV's, Trucks

Once it is running, work is:
- For each of the cars, you need to draw the cars e.g. draw car, draw SUV and draw Truck/Lorry. Draw in code. Distance of two points should not be fixed. It should be generated by an equation. Sizes of the car should be different for each simulation. Function of length should be random. Shapes can be same but sizes are different. Shade the vehicles as well i.e. colour filling. Colour filling should also be random. 

- Environment where the vehicle appears should have some flowers. i.e. flowers on the ground below vehicles appearance. There is existing code to draw flowers which we can import. Roses should be random in colour. Flowers can be same size.

- Use equation of generating random values (a + u(b-a))
