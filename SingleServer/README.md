# Single Server Simulation

This program is used to simulate a *single-server queuing system*.
The program was originally in C extracted from page 51 of the book **[Simulation-Modeling-and-Analysis-Averill-M.-Law-Edisi-5-2014.](https://industri.fatek.unpatti.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/108-Simulation-Modeling-and-Analysis-Averill-M.-Law-Edisi-5-2014.pdf)**

The `mm1.in` and `mm2.out` files are provided here.

The original C code is also provided with comments in ``serve.c`` and slighly modified version in ``serve-new.c``
The final code implemented in python is found at ``server.py``
